**Business Problem & Solution**
In the retail industry, it is vital that companies are able to keep up with the supply and
demand on products they are offering. Some companies may choose to keep track of this supply
and demand through physical books and paperwork, and over time this can result in insufficient
storage space, misplaced orders by human error, and overall customer dissatisfaction.
Our proposed solution demonstrates how a retail company that sells electronic items goes
about digitally managing inventory based on orders that are fulfilled and returned. First and
foremost, we allow customers to create accounts within our system that store data such as first
name, last name, address, etc. This data is used when a customer creates an order with different
items to ensure that the right orders are being associated with the right customers. In addition to
this, when an order is placed, we will make sure that the correct amount of each item in the order
is removed from the inventory. On the other hand, if a customer wants to return an item, we also
have the capability to create a return order and readjust the inventory of the item.
